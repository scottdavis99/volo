		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
Grails and Rails developers have known for years how great it is to drive your server-side web development process from the command line. Now Volo.js offers the same experience for client-side developers. Type "volo create myapp" to lay out the initial directory structure, "volo add jquery" to download and add the JavaScript libraries you need, and even "volo ghdeploy" to publish your website to GitHub.
		</p>

		<p>
Come see how quickly you can get up and running with Volo.js, and how quickly you'll find you can't live without it.
